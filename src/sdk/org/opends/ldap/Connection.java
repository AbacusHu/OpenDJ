/**
 * A connection with a Directory Server over which read and update
 * operations may be performed. See RFC 4511 for the LDAPv3 protocol
 * specification and more information about the types of operations
 * defined in LDAP.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Operation processing</h3>
 * <p>
 * All operations are performed asynchronously and return a
 * {@link ResultFuture} or sub-type thereof which can be used for
 * retrieving the result using the {@link ResultFuture#get} method.
 * Operation failures, for whatever reason, are signalled by the
 * {@link ResultFuture#get()} method throwing an
 * {@link ErrorResultException}.
 * <p>
 * Synchronous operations are easily simulated by immediately getting
 * the result:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Connection connection = ...;
 * AddRequest request = ...;
 * // Will block until operation completes, and
 * // throws exception on failure.
 * connection.add(request).get();
 * </pre>
 *
 * Operations can be performed in parallel whilst taking advantage of
 * the simplicity of a synchronous application design:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Connection connection1 = ...;
 * Connection connection2 = ...;
 * AddRequest request = ...;
 * // Add the entry to the first server (don't block).
 * ResultFuture future1 = connection1.add(request);
 * // Add the entry to the second server (in parallel).
 * ResultFuture future2 = connection2.add(request);
 * // Total time = is O(1) instead of O(n).
 * future1.get();
 * future2.get();
 * </pre>
 *
 * More complex client applications can take advantage of a fully
 * asynchronous event driven design using {@link ResponseHandler}s:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Connection connection = ...;
 * SearchRequest request = ...;
 * // Process results in the search result handler
 * // in a separate thread.
 * SearchResponseHandler handle = ...;
 * connection.search(request, handler);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <h3>Closing connections</h3>
 * <p>
 * Applications must ensure that a connection is closed by calling
 * {@link #close()} even if a fatal error occurs on the connection. Once
 * a connection has been closed by the client application, any attempts
 * to continue to use the connection will result in an
 * {@link IllegalStateException} being thrown. Note that, if a fatal
 * error is encountered on the connection, then the application can
 * continue to use the connection. In this case all requests subsequent
 * to the failure will fail with an appropriate
 * {@link ErrorResultException} when their result is retrieved.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Event notification</h3>
 * <p>
 * Applications can choose to be notified when a connection is closed by
 * the application, receives an unsolicited notification, or experiences
 * a fatal error by registering a {@link ConnectionEventListener} with
 * the connection using the {@link #addConnectionEventListener} method.
 * <p>
 * <h3>TO DO</h3>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>do we need isClosed() and isValid()?
 * <li>do we need connection event notification of client close? JDBC
 * and JCA have this functionality in their pooled (managed) connection
 * APIs. We need some form of event notification at the app level for
 * unsolicited notifications.
 * <li>method for adding an entry.
 * <li>method for performing update operation (e.g. LDIF change
 * records).
 * <li>simple search API with blocking entry iterator and easy access to
 * first entry.
 * <li>should unsupported methods throw UnsupportedOperationException or
 * throw an ErrorResultException using an UnwillingToPerform result code
 * (or something similar)?
 * </ul>
 *
 * @see <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511">RFC 4511 -
 *      Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol </a>
